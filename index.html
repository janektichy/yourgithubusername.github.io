        <h1>Janek Tichý</h1>

        <h2>Future software developer</h2>

        <p>My name is Jan Tichý, but I prefer be called "Janek," because my father is also Jan and my mother is a practical woman, so she gave me the same name, but she calls me differently since I was born. </p>
        <p>I started to learn programming as kind of a blind shot but now I am really enjoying it and I am definitely satisfied with my choice</p>
